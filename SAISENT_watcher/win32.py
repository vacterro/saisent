"""Reading and driving windows through ctypes. No new dependency.

Two jobs: list the windows the user can pick a target from, and post input
at one of them without touching focus or the clipboard.

Everything goes through an injected `api` object. The real one is built
lazily and is None wherever user32 is not there, so a test constructs a fake
and no test can reach a real window — the one accident this module must be
incapable of.

Posting rather than typing is what keeps it silent: the user carries on
working in another window while the queue drains. The honest limits of that
are recorded on `PostLayer` rather than papered over.
