"""The watcher state machine: when may the next prompt go out?

Decides, and only decides. `tick()` returns an INTENT — a composed string
and the item it came from — and something else does the typing. Keeping the
decision separate from the act is what makes every rule here testable
without a window, an agent, or a keyboard.

Reality arrives as arguments (the clock, the probes, whether the target is
still there, whether something is blocking), so a test can describe any
situation without faking an operating system.
