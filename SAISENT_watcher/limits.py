"""Reading "limit reached" out of an agent's own words.

Agents say it in prose, in their chat transcript, and each one says it
differently. This turns that prose into a decision: is the limit hit right
now, and if the text names a reset time, when.

Qt-free and clock-injected, so every pattern is testable without an agent
running and without waiting for a real reset.

Two rules:

* **Ambiguity is NOT a limit.** A false "reached" pauses a queue that could
  have kept working; a false "clear" only means the watcher tries and the
  agent refuses. So a match has to be specific, and the word "limit" alone
  is not enough — "no limit", "limit: 200k" and "rate limits apply" are all
  ordinary UI text.
* **A time we did not read is None, never a guess.** Callers decide what
  window to assume; inventing "+5h" here would bury that guess where nobody
  can see it.
