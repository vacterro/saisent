"""Probes: cheap ways to ask whether an agent has stopped working.

Every probe answers one question — "does this look idle right now?" — and
the engine only acts when all of them agree for a sustained window.

Two rules run through the whole file:

* **Uncertainty is not idleness.** A missing file, an unreadable database, a
  probe whose optional dependency is not installed: all report BUSY. The
  cost of a wrong "idle" is a prompt typed into a running agent; the cost of
  a wrong "busy" is waiting a bit longer.
* **The clock is an argument.** Nothing here calls time.time() on its own,
  so the quiet-window logic is testable without sleeping.
