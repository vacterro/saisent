"""Sending: the only part of the watcher that can do damage.

Everything dangerous is behind an injected interface — the clipboard and the
keystrokes are objects passed in, never built here. A test drives a recorder
and therefore can never point real keystrokes at a real window, which is the
one accident this module must be incapable of.

Four rules:

* **Silent by default.** The whole point is that it works while the user is
  doing something else. A sender that pulls the foreground window away
  mid-keystroke is worse than no sender, so the default strategy posts input
  straight at the target and never touches focus or the clipboard.
  Focus-stealing exists, but only when explicitly allowed.
* **Dry run is the default.** `build_sender()` returns a recorder unless the
  caller explicitly asks for a live one.
* **Identity is rechecked at the moment of sending**, not at arming. A window
  that has closed, or been replaced by another with the same handle, must
  abort the send rather than receive it.
* **The text is snapshotted when it goes.** Items follow their source line,
  so the wording can change up to the last instant; the log has to record
  what actually left, not what a row displayed earlier.
